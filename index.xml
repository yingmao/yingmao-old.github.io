      <description>Q5 Our solution requires multiple MapReduce iterations. We have to: calculate whether items sales for any given month went up or down, create lists of items with the same sales change during the same month, find number of co-occurrences in those lists, choose items with maximum co-occurrences.
First iteration calculates sales changes for any given month. We have to supply mapper, partitioner, custom sort and reducer. Mapper generates one intermediate key/value pair for each input key/value.</description>

      <description>Description (CISC4615, Fall 2018) This course provides an introduction to fundamental concepts in the design and implementation of computer communication networks, their protocols, and applications. Topics to be covered include: overview of network architectures, applications, network programming interfaces (e.g., sockets), transport, congestion, routing, and data link protocols, addressing, local area networks, wireless networks, network security, and network management. Examples will be drawn primarily from the Internet (e.g., TCP, UDP, and IP) protocol suite.</description>

      <description>Dynamic Resource Management for Cloud Computing 

1. Virtualized Computing Systems (Docker and Kubernetes) Virtualization is a promising technology that has facilitated cloud computing to become the next wave of the Internet revolution. Adopted by data centers, millions of applications that are powered by various virtual machines improve the quality of services. Although virtual machines are well-isolated among each other, they suffer from redundant boot volumes and slow provisioning time.</description>
